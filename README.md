# Scala 3 implementations of 8 queens problem

It's inspired by [Typescripting the technical interview](https://www.richard-towers.com/2023/03/11/typescripting-the-technical-interview.html) by Richard Towers.

This repository contains a few implementations of the problem on different levels:
- plain Scala;
- type-level (2 versions);
- meta-level.
